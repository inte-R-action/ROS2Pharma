```python
# Example: Good function documentation
def analyze_contamination(image: np.ndarray, threshold: float = 0.7) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Analyze IV bag image for contamination.
    
    Args:
        image: Input image as numpy array (H, W, C)
        threshold: Detection confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing contamination metrics:
        - particle_count: Number of detected particles
        - bubble_count: Number of detected bubbles
        - confidence: Average detection confidence
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If threshold is not in valid range
        
    Note:
        This function is critical for patient safety. Any modifications
        must be thoroughly tested and validated.
    """
```
