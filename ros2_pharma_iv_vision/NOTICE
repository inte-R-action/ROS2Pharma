IMPORTANT PHARMACEUTICAL SAFETY NOTICE:

This software is designed for research and development purposes in pharmaceutical 
quality control applications. While the system achieves 96.2% contamination 
detection accuracy and complies with EU GMP Annex 1 guidelines, users must:

1. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE: Ensure compliance with local pharmaceutical regulations
   before deployment in production environments. Additional validation and 
   regulatory approval may be required.

2. SAFETY VALIDATION: Conduct thorough safety validation and risk assessment
   according to applicable pharmaceutical quality standards.

3. PROFESSIONAL OVERSIGHT: Use only under the supervision of qualified 
   pharmaceutical professionals.

4. CONTINUOUS MONITORING: Implement continuous monitoring and validation 
   procedures as required by pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices.
